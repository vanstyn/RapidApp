    # support for merging of user defined schemas with the CoreSchema as well
    # as user-supplied databases to be used as the CoreSchema. Obviously, 
    # neither checksum or version checks are useful for these dynamic scenarios,
    # which is why the plan is to define a set of specific rules and tests

    # CoreSchema. It is expected that DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff will do the 
    # heavy lifting for this.

    # fine-grained filtering (and, in fact, this planned RapidApp feature is
    # the entire reason I wrote DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff in the first place,

=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Model::RapidApp::CoreSchema - DBIC model for the CoreSchema database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyApp;
 
 use Catalyst   qw/ RapidApp::CoreSchema /;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Catalyst model which is automatcally injected by the 
L<RapidApp::CoreSchema|Catalyst::Plugin::RapidApp::CoreSchema> plugin and is not
intended to be loaded directly.

With the default configuration, this model automatically initializes and deploys itself
to an SQLite database file in the root of the application named C<rapidapp_coreschema.db>.

The CoreSchema database is a common location used for persistence by multiple optional
"Core" plugins, such as L<AuthCore|Catalyst::Plugin::RapidApp::AuthCore> and 
L<NavCore|Catalyst::Plugin::RapidApp::NavCore>
